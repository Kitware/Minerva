Minerva is a sophisticated geospatial application and framework created to enable users to upload, visualize, and analyze small to large geospatial data from a web interface. Minerva uses advancements in web and database technologies such as WebGL and  NoSQL(MongoDB) database.

Some of the highlights of Minerva include using a web-enabled data management [Girder](http://www.github.com/Girder/girder) to manage data, metadata, sessions and employing high-performance geospatial data visualization library [GeoJS](http://www.github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs)
to provide fast interactive visualization of geospatial data on a map.
developed by Kitware. Additionally, Minerva uses one or many open-source tools such as Gaia, GDAL, Shapely, and Fiona.

Minerva is designed for big data and cloud enabled data analysis and visualization.
