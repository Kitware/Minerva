Creating a Source
=================
I think it's easier to work on the backend first, as you can test the api independently of the client. We'll work through an example using the Elasticsearch source.

Source API
----------
Create an endpoint to create the source, copy server/rest/wms_source.py to server/rest/elasticsearch_source.py and modify accordingly.

Important points are
- use the access decorator to ensure only logged in users can call the endpoint
- create minerva_metadata with the correct source_type
- save the source using the superclass method createSource
- return the document corresponding to the new source
- here we store the authentication credentials after encryption
- set the description object to display the params correctly on the swagger api page

Add the endpoint to server/loader.py

::

   info['apiRoot'].minerva_source_elasticsearch = elasticsearch_source.ElasticsearchSource()

You should now be able to see your endpoint through the swagger api page, and test it there. Usually

::

   http://localhost:8080/api

Testing the Source API
----------------------
Create a test, copy plugin_tests/wms_test.py to plugin_tests/elasticsearch_test.py.

Add the test to plugin.cmake

::

   add_python_test(elasticsearch PLUGIN minerva)

Run cmake PATH_TO_GIRDER_DIR again in your build directory to pick up the new test.

Now you should see the new test in your build directory

::

   ctest -N | grep minerva
     Test #110: server_minerva.dataset
     Test #111: server_minerva.source
     Test #112: server_minerva.session
     Test #113: server_minerva.analysis
     Test #114: server_minerva.geonames
     Test #115: server_minerva.s3_dataset
     Test #116: server_minerva.import_analyses
     Test #117: server_minerva.contour_analysis
     Test #118: server_minerva.wms
     Test #119: server_minerva.elasticsearch
     Test #120: server_minerva.geojson
     Test #121: server_minerva.mean_contour_analysis
     Test #122: pep8_style_minerva_constants
     Test #123: pep8_style_minerva_geonames
     Test #124: pep8_style_minerva_rest
     Test #125: pep8_style_minerva_utility
     Test #126: pep8_style_minerva_bsve
     Test #127: pep8_style_minerva_jobs
     Test #128: jshint_minerva
     Test #129: jsstyle_minerva
     Test #130: web_client_minerva

You can run the test, with extra verbosity

::

   ctest -R server_minerva.elasticsearch -VV

Also check your python style, and fix any errors

::

   ctest -R pep8_style_minerva_rest -VV

Add a new Source Model
----------------------

If your model is simple, with only its specific endpoint and source type to
differentiate it, you can add a line to the bottom of
web_external/js/models/SourceModel.js calling ``createSourceModel``, which
will create the model for you and register it with the minerva application.

::

    minerva.createSourceModel('WmsSourceModel', 'wms', 'minerva_source_wms');

If your source model needs to do something more specific, such as override
``destroy`` or respond to a creation failure, add a new model
like web_external/js/models/S3SourceModel.js, and be sure to register
your new model with the minerva application.

::

    minerva.registerSourceModel('S3SourceModel', 's3', S3SourceModel);

Add the Source to AddSourceWidget
---------------------------------
Create a widget to add your new source type, e.g. AddElasticsearchSourceWidget

::

   web_external/js/views/widgets/AddElasticsearchSourceWidget.js
   web_external/templates/widgets/addElasticsearchSourceWidget.jade


Add your new source type along with a reference to the create widget to the dictionary in AddSourceWidget.js.

Test that when you click on the add new source icon in the source panel, your new source type is displayed as an option.

Add an Action to the Source Displayed in the Source Panel
---------------------------------------------------------
If it makes sense for your source to have an action, as when there is a natural path to create a dataset from your source, add an action to the source displayed in the source panel.

E.g., a WMS source naturally creates datasets by exposing a set of WMS layers and allowing one or more to be created as a dataset. An Elasticsearch source naturally creates datasets by running an analysis which is a search query, resulting in a JSON dataset with a default visualization as GeoJson.

Add an event handler for your source icon in web_external/js/views/body/SourcePanel.js .

Add the widget constructed and rendered by the event handler

::

   web_external/js/views/widgets/ElasticsearchWidget.js
   web_external/templates/widgets/elasticsearchWidget.jade

Comply with Javascript styles
-----------------------------
Because it's the law of the land.

::

   ctest -R jshint_minerva -VV
   ctest -R jsstyle_minerva -VV
